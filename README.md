# leaf2mqtt

**This is a work in progress.**

> :warning: If you're not using the car frequently, stop the container or drastically reduce the update frequency, or you could well end up with a flat 12V battery.

* Support for other regions is planned.

This works for my Canadian 2019 LEAF 40kWh car. Please open an issue if it also works for your different model and/or region, I will update this list.

More documentation will follow.

You must have a working MQTT server on your LAN.
